## 2048 game overall design ideas
#### (i) The game interface is initialized, there are 4 rows and 4 columns, a total of 16 positions, when the game starts, in any two positions, randomly generate numbers 2 or 4 (the probability of generating 2 is higher).
#### (ii) Players can control the movement of all numbers through W\A\S\D or keyboard arrow keys. During the game, it must comply with the basic rules of the 2048 game.
#### (iii) When there is no free position in the game, and the adjacent numbers cannot be merged, the game over.
